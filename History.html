                Hi there! Welcome to Project Nodenium.

                the past seasons feel free to message Camo#0477 on Discord. I'll be happy to answer any questions you have! Enjoy!

                    The server was started back somewhere in May of 2015 by the founder Camo, the exact date is lost to time. 
                    It was run off of an old iPhone 4 that sat under a desk fan, far from the setup we have today. The server looked
                    very different back then, nobody could've imagined what it would become. The server was originally called "LPS" (Let's Play Survival) and only
                    consisted of a few friends from school. There were no mega-builds or crazy farms, just some good old-fashioned 2015 survival.

                    This LPS era of the server lasted for 10 seasons, each being relatively short and uneventful. Nonetheless, 
                    it was the start to building what would become the server we know and love today.
                    <br><br>
                    Then finally, after years of the server being private, Camo decided to open it up to the public. The first member applied and joined the server on
                    June 29th, 2019 during season 10. This sparked a massive revolution. Almost all the original members, who were all real-life friends of Camo, left the server with the new
                    influx of external members, although, Camo kept the server going and it continued to grow.

                    And so began the next chapter of the server. We were officially trying to become something. We had big hopes and big ideas
                    but no real direction. We were just a bunch of kids who wanted to play Minecraft together. We had no idea what we were doing and no structure
                    to the mod team or server. Trying to seem more professional, we decided to rename the server to "Hydrocraft". A name that didn't stick for too long.

                    After seeing what it took to run a public server, the whole mod team was completely burnt out after only a month.
                    If they wanted this server to continue, they needed to make some changes. So they did. They restructured the way things were organized and 
                    tried bringing the server back to more of a survival feel. And you know what? It completely failed! Absolute disaster. The server was only up
                    for a couple of weeks before not a single person played on it. This completely demoralized the team and the community and we gave up on the
                    dream of having our own server.

                    But you wouldn't be reading this right now if we had given up. So what happened? Well in early January 2020
                    Camo got a message from that very first member to ever join asking if there was going to be another season. Camo was shocked. He hadn't even thought about 
                    Minecraft for months but this one message reignited his passion for the game. He decided to give it another shot and started working on pursuing
                    the supposedly impossible goal of making a public SMP work. He started by recruiting a new mod team and reworking the server from the ground up.
                    Giving up the old name of Hydrocraft, a new name, "Nodecraft" was born. Now that's starting to look a little more familiar, isn't it?

                    This time it was going to be completely different. No more relaxation. If this was going to work we were going to have to take
                    it seriously. We were going to have to work hard. And that's exactly what we did. We worked our asses off. We furiously recruited new members and
                    onboarded a large staff of mods so that there could be at least one person online and active at all times. Everything was monitored through command blocks
                    and we had a strict set of rules that everyone had to follow. We were going to make this work no matter what it took.

                    But of course, working 12-16 hour shifts every day for months is unsustainable. Slowly but surely staff members 
                    started to burn out and leave. The server started to turn to anarchy. With such a massive player base and no staff to moderate it: crime became rampant.
                    After 100 days of the season being up, we decided to call it quits. We had tried a small server, but that got boring. We tried a massive server, but 
                    that was chaos. We needed to find a happy medium.

                    Season 4 was just that. Our happy medium. This was the first season that we started to figure out what we wanted
                    out of this server and had enough experience with running a server and managing a community to make it work. We still had a relatively large player base
                    but we had a much smaller staff team and a much more relaxed set of rules. We were able to focus on the community and the people who were playing on the
                    server instead of the server itself. This made all the difference. There were still a few issues with griefers and toxic players but we were able to handle
                    them quickly and efficiently. But most importantly, we made the server a genuinely fun place to be. We had almost achieved our goal of making an oasis in the
                    mess that is the Minecraft SMP community.

                    everyone who applied we were able to focus on finding skilled builders and technical players to join. But when the 1.16 Nether Update came out 
                    the server experienced some game-breaking bugs that made it impossible to play. It ruined the season for ages and we were forced to shut it down
                    and wait for the bugs to be fixed. It was a very abrupt end to a very fun season.

                    Season 7 looked promising. We had a lot of new players and a lot of old players coming back. Everyone was super excited to be playing on the server again.
                    But after a few weeks, it was evident that it was not going to last as long as we thought it would. Many players were getting quickly burnt out and leaving.

                    In season 8, with the Caves and Cliffs update rapidly approaching, we decided to implement a data pack that would allow us to play the new update early.
                    While this seemed like a great idea, in theory, it ended up being a disaster. The data pack was buggy and caused issues and lag.

                    Once again like in season 7, however, while we had our fun it came to an end quickly. So many of us had planned insanely ambitious projects for the season
                    that soon presented themselves as far more difficult than we had anticipated. Burnout was a huge issue and we were all getting tired of the server.
                    Two bad seasons in a row was not what we wanted. We had to do something different. Ownership of the server was passed to Vyruz, who had been a moderator
                    and a great player for the past few seasons. While we were all excited to see what he would do with the server, we were all still a little sceptical that
                    he would be able to keep the server alive after all the previous failures.

                    Now under the leadership of Vyruz, season 9 was a huge success. We had a lot of new players and the strongest community we had ever had. Everyone was
                    having a great time with no burnout for months. Projects were bigger and better than ever. The server was thriving thanks to the way Vyruz had planned
                    it, where we are all in proximity to each other and can easily work together on projects as we all live on a single giant continent.

                    It wasn't perfect though, what would be a season without something going wrong? We got contacted by the owner of a company called 'Nodecraft',
                    a server hoster with the same name as us that we had no idea about. They claimed that we were infringing on their trademark and that we had to change our
                    name. We had no other choice but to change our name and branding, which we chose 'Project Nodenium'.
                    <br><br>
                    This proved to be a beneficial change for us. We took it as an opportunity to rebrand and restructure the server from a small traditional SMP to a 
                    serious building community server with a focus on large-scale projects, the identity we still uphold to this day.

                    Taking what we had learned about being close to each other and working together, we decided to take it to the next level. We decided to all live
                    in a small town we built up in a valley called 'The Bowl'. Here we had all our starter bases and shops within only a few seconds walk of each other.
                    We build even more absolutely massive projects such as our glorious nether hub.

                    But we didn't just upgrade our builds. Once again with the huge developments in the size of our builds and our farms, the lag started to become an issue.
                    Hosting the server on that crappy laptop wasn't gonna work much longer. So we decided to upgrade to a dedicated server. With the insanely generous donations
                    from our community, we were able to upgrade our server to an extremely powerful machine that could handle anything we threw at it in just a week. It's
                    amazing what can be achieved when everyone works together.

                    It's been a hell of a long journey to get to where we are today. We've had some very high highs and some very low lows. 
                    But we've made it this far and we're not stopping anytime soon. Looking back to the first season, I don't think anybody could've
                    predicted just how far we'd come and I am so incredibly proud of what we've achieved. Thank you to everone who's been a 
                    part of this community. I can't wait to see what the future holds.
